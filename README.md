## Self-Assessment

- We think our project deserves a 16 out of 20.

## Extra Elements

- Our project supports Constant Propagation and Constant Folding with the "-o" flag set to either "true", for optimizing, or "false", this being the default. This only propagates literal constants, as it could, in theory, propagate code like "1+this.foo()" as long as this variable was never changed, however, this would add more operations done for anytime the variable would be referenced.

- With the "-r=<n>" the registers used in Ollir and Jasmin can be optimized, with -1 for no optimization, 0 for optimization on, and >1 for choosing a maximum number of registers used, being that the compilation fails and stops halfway in the case of not having enough registers.
